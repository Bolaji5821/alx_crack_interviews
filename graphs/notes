def: 
  collection of nodes that may or may not be connected to one another.

  every node is called a vertex
  and connections are called edges

  Graphs are made up of edges and vertices.

Types:

  connected graphs: you can reach any node.

  disconnected graphs: when there exist nodes that cant be reached.
  ex: locations and transportation routes

  directed and undirected graphs
  ex: flights(directed), friendship on facebook(undirected)

  cyclic and acyclic graphs
  cyclic: you have three or more nodes that go through an infinite loop.
